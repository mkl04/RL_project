Implementation of DQN and Double DQN for Atari Games.

### Objective
Verify the advantage of the Double DQN algorithm over DQN (Deep Q Network) for two Atari games.

### Environments
Only two games were chosen for training time reasons. These were Tennis and Space Invaders, since they demonstrated better results using [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461), as well as superiority with respect to human-level performance. The environments were taken from the open-source library [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), offered by OpenAI.

### Solution
The code used is a customized version of the code shared on the Youtube channel [brthor1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mmZUMvTNzzz2sS_tgbKVQ).

### Results
In the following link, it is shown a run for Space Invaders with a trained model for DQN.
